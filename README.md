# <p align="center"> Implementing a Deep Reinforcement Learning Model for Autonomous Driving </p>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing extraordinarily in almost every area of technology, and research into self-driving cars is one of them. In this work, we will take the liberty to utilize state-of-the-art methods to train our agent to drive autonomously using the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach. We will use an open-source simulator, [CARLA](http://carla.org/), to conduct our experiment, providing a hyper-realistic urban simulation environment to train our models. We cannot use our raw algorithms in the real world because they come with many risks and moral questions, so we use these simulators to help us test them.

Moreover, DRL has shown promising results in learning complex decision-making tasks, from strategic games to challenging puzzles. Here, we will look at how an on-policy DRL algorithm called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) will be used in a simulated driving environment to learn to navigate on a predetermined route. The primary goal of this work is to investigate how a DRL model can train an agent on a continuous state and action space. Our main contribution is a PPO-based agent that can learn to drive reliably in our CARLA-based environment. In addition, we also implemented a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that compresses high-dimensional observations into a potentially easier-to-learn low-dimensional latent space that can help our agent learn faster.



## About the Project

This work aims to develop an end-to-end solution for autonomous driving that can send commands to the vehicle to help it drive in the right direction and avoid crashes as much as possible, and is divided in the following components:

1. CARLA Environment setup.
2. Variational Autoencoder.
3. Proximal Policy Optimization.

We have used [CALRA](http://carla.org/) (version 0.9.8) as our environment (Urban Simulator). We have also summarized some results and analyses to simplify this problem further.

### Prerequisites

We're using [CARLA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases) (0.9.8) + Additional Maps. We're mainly focused on two towns which are Town 2 and Town 7, therefore we'd advice you download Additional Maps file alongside the CARLA server. You can copy/paste the maps from **Additional Maps** directory to **Main** CARLA directory to ensure everything is seemless.

Moving forth we'd advice you to setup your project on **Windows** or **Linux** as these are the two OSs supported by CARLA at the moment. 

## Project Setup (Installations)

In order to setup this project you're advised to clone this repository and make sure you have **Python v3.7.+ (64bit)** version installed. After clonding this repository we can create a python virtual environment for this project ðŸ’¥ let's call it **venv** `python -m venv venv`. You can call it something else if you want :) Now we can activate our virtual env `source venv/Script/activate`, and don't forget to do so before installing any of the dependencies. Moving forward we can install the dependencies with `pip` with the following command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. We're not only using **pip** as our depency manager but **poetry** as well, therefore execute the following command `cd poetry/ && poetry update` in the repo. This will install all the other dependencies now with **poetry**. Once everything is setup up we're nearly there! 

Download the **CARLA server (0.9.8)** + **Additional Maps**, and make sure you've read the Prerequisites of this repo. Once the server is up and running, we can start our client with `python driver.py --train=False` command. Don't forget to start the Carla server beforehand. Yey!!!
